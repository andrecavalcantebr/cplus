# cplus

Cplus is an experiment over C language. We fall back 30 years and we reedit C with Class.

The idea is put OOP syntax directly over standard C23. And... just it. Nothing of templates or
other "complex stuff" find in C++ and other languages.

The goal is the programmer can be see the C code generated and can change everything. 
Everything is under your control as C. 

The parser run just before all the actual compiler chain and generate pure C.

Like C you can use heap or stack.

See docs/cplus_specs.md to more detail.
